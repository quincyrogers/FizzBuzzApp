# FizzBuzz

An introductory Test Driven Development (TDD) exercise

## Rules of FizzBuzz
- read in a number greater than 0
- return back that number unless...
	- number is divisible by 3: return Fizz
	- number is divisible by 5: return Buzz
	- divisible by 3 and 5: return Fizz Buzz

## Rules of TDD
- start with the test
- you cannot write any production code unless it is to fix a failure in the test in the simplest way possible 
- cannot write any more of a test then what gets to a failure (syntax errors, or a red test)
